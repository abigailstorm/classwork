      I AM FROM
      </h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">I am created by strong women.
I was raised by women, by a series of strong women, 
Each broken and fixed by life
All the cracks different, but running along similar lines.

I am a creation of my mothers,
Those women who protected me 
And accepted me as their own. 

I am a creation of loss, 
Loss of pets, loss of loved ones,
I am from the bones of past pets,
Whose memories I hold dear,
I am from the series of stones in the garden,
Marking their graves.

I am a creation of New England, mostly Vermont. 
I am from the river rocks,
The twigs and worn glass,
The chickens, the squirrels and the feral cats.
I am from the wood smoke, the car fumes, 
And the vibrantly dying town that I call my home.

I am a creation of pain and joy,
Grown from the puns and tears,
And from the cat and dog hair that covers the sofa of my heart and my family’s.

      <h1>LUCKY</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I hate that I feel lucky. 
I hate that I feel fortunate because I’ve only been sexually harassed walking down the street twice in my life.
I hate that I feel blessed by an absence of repeated cruelty shouted at me by strangers. 
Because I know that I am lucky. 
I know that there are women and children being raped behind doors in this town. 
Because I am lucky I do not deal with the rage and hurt everyday that comes from having my will taken from me. 
I am lucky that of the two times I was screamed at, 
Once when I was ten, and the other at age twenty one,
The men behind the wheels of those cars passing by
Did not choose to stop. 
I was lucky to be in a public place. 
I am lucky that instead of having my fear of men confirmed
It simply hangs over me. 
A shadow, tainting and mocking me,
Every time I walk past a man on a dark street. 
I am lucky that I have a support base,
Should the worst happen.
That I have been trained since birth to say that it is not my fault. 
I am lucky because other women do not have this. 
I am lucky that I have only been verbally accosted twice. 
Aren’t I so fucking lucky?

      <h1>THIGHS</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">When I was younger, but not by much,
I went to a poetry slam at my school.
She came onto the stage,
Chocolate skinned, curvy and so full of strength. 
I do not remember much of her poem, but one line has stuck with me.
“These thighs my mother gave me.” 
Her poem was one of inner strength, of love for one’s body. 
These thighs my mother gave me. 
I too have been blessed and cursed with thighs from my mother. 
I have shoved them in skinny jeans,
A desperate attempt to suffocate the fact
That I did not have the “ideal” body type. 
I have hidden them in billowing skirts, 
Hiding myself as well. 

Now I am older, but not by much,
I acknowledge that these thighs my mother gave me are not going away. 
I do not really want them to. 
These thighs my mother gave me 
Are not meant to be fixed
They are not broken. 
These thighs my mother gave me
Are a sign of strength. 
A sign that I am here,
That I exist.
