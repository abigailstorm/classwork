     IN THE BEGINNING
      </h5>

<p>In the beginning there was the void. Songs have been sung about this void in cultures around the world, and in modern tales of the past as well. Tales of the void that are of particular relevance to this hedgewitch include the tales from the Norse and Greek myths, as well as from the “Children of the Earth” series of books by Jean M. Aule. </p>
	<p>In Greek Myth it was Gaea who came out of the darkness first (D'Aulaire, D'Aulaire, 1962). She was joined by Uranus, her starry lover and from their union sprang forth the Titans, the Gods, and all life. These tales were told to me as a child, young and impressionable. Then I would go on as a teenager to read other tales; tales created from others in a piecemeal and stuck together in a fantasy novel. This tale was my gospel as I was a teen.</p>
<p>Out of the darkness, the chaos of time</p>
<p>The whirlwind gave birth to the Mother sublime.</p> 
<p>She woke to Herself, knowing life had great worth.</p> 
<p>The dark empty void grieved the Great Mother Earth</p>
<p>The Mother was lonely, she was the only.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>She dared the great void, the chaos, the dark</p>
<p>To find the cold home of the life-giving spark.</p> 
<p>The whirlwind was fearsome, the darkness complete.</p> 
<p>The Chaos was freezing and reached out for Her heat.</p> 
<p>The Mother was brave. The danger was grave.</p> 
<p>She drew from cold chaos the creative source.</p> 
<p>Then, conceiving within, She fled with life-force.</p> 
<p>She grew with the life that She carried inside</p>
<p>And gave from Herself, with love and with pride.</p> 
<p>The Mother was bearing, Her life she was sharing (Aule, 2002).</p>
<p>Then Norse Myth, my current, and hopefully last, pantheon has another theory as to the beginning of the worlds. Here are multiple worlds, or realities, being born one after the other. First was Muspellheim, a world of fire. Then was the great void, called Ginnungagap and after that came the cold realm of Niflheim. In Ginnungagap the cold from Niflheim and the warmth from Muspellheim mixed and created Ymir, the Jotun who would go onto become the Earth (Ashliman, 2010). But it all started with a spark. The spark from Muspellhiem. Like the beginning of creation there was also a spark that created me. This spark of passion between my mother and the man who donated sperm (and not much else) towards my creation. This was my beginning.</p> 
<p>2. The Early Years</p> 
<p>I recall very little about the early years of my life. What I do remember exists in snatched away memories that are pieced together from conversations and dreams. They consist of will-o-the-wisps that taunt my current life from the corners of my eyes. Like our current universe a world existed before mine did and had a direct influence on mine. This world belonged to my mother. She was young and had a very hard childhood. Grandpa David, her father, died when she was about eleven years of age. Grandma Lynda, her mother, soon fell into a deep depression and series of mental breaks that Mama suspects was bipolar disorder, or something very like it. As soon as she could, Mama ran away to boarding school. The Meeting House, a Quaker boarding school, helped her detox from her mother’s stolen medicine and get her life on track. She left them, feeling at odds with the security they represented. Over my life I have been told a series of disjointed tales about the years after. I know she went to a Sundance, and was forced to eat her wolf-hybrid’s dog food (they forgot to feed her) while being ostracized due to her period (the Native women looked at the white girls like they were idiots for letting it be known that they were bleeding). I was told warning tales of Mama hitch-hiking across the United States, with the statement, “If you ever do something so stupid, I’ll kill you myself!” being the end of it.</p> 
	<p>Somewhere in this morass of stories she met my biological father while at college. Her childhood had left her feeling unworthy of love, so she hooked onto the man who showed her a scrap of affection. She went in head first and started to raise his children, only seven years younger than herself. They were stupid, and didn’t use birth control. During a blizzard on November 26th, 1993 I was born. My creation had been accomplished.</p> 
	<p>As stated above, I don’t know much of my early years. I know what I’ve been told, however. Mama became more and more aware of how she was being abused. I don’t know how bad it became. Asking about that was always a taboo subject, one of the few that existed between Mama and myself. Mama told me that she got the advice from his mother that she should leave. Leaving my two half sisters was the hardest thing that she had ever done. Fast forward ten years and my half sister Amy told me that she respected my mother more than anyone else for getting me out of the situation. (Amy’s doing well; she married herself a Marine who would never hit her and has given me two gorgeous nephews).</p> 
	<p>Mama took me with her to Marlboro College, a small liberal arts college on top of Southern Vermont. It’s here that I start to have more memories. Memories include the small log cabin of married student housing. There were blueberry bushes outside with blue orbs the size of quarters. The taste and smell of blueberry pancakes for lunch and dinner fill these memories. The feel of a soft old quilt being laid over a sleeping three year old that rested on the braided rug in front of the fire place. Being pampered by college students and going to bed to the clicking of Mama’s pen as she wrote her term papers. All good memories, are these.</p> 
	<p>Mama went on to bring me with her to Oxford. It was there that I have my first recollections of religious thought. Mama’s degree was going to be in Ancient Greek Literature, or something of the like. I was four and going on precocious so whatever Mama was studying I wanted to study it as well. So she bought me “D’Aulaire’s Book of Greek Myths” and we set to reading it with a vengeance. I was entranced; these Gods were nothing like I had ever encountered. Tales of the Trojan War became my bedtime stories, tales of tricky Hermes, and vain Kings.</p> 
	<p>At this age I was already realizing that I was different from my peers. They connected with each other easily in a way that I just couldn’t. So when Mama read me “The Abduction of Persephone” I didn’t see Hades as the villain. No, I saw him as being as much of a victim as Persephone. He had been outcast by his shining brothers and was lonely. All he wanted was a friend (of course I was too young to realize that he probably wanted sex as well). And the picture of the abduction showed him looking so worried; and I imagined Persephone as pretending that she was upset. This would be the beginning of my connection to the darker, outcast Gods.</p> 
<p>3. The Middling Years.</p> 
<p>Greek mythology continued to occupy my religious thoughts throughout my early and mid-childhood. Mama and I moved to Martha’s Vineyard, an island off of Cape Cod. Walking through downtown Edgartown in my memory consists of a cacophony of smells. There’s the fish and salt smell coming from the ocean, the warm smell of the cobblestone and pavement, the melty smell of the trees, and the occasional smells wafting out of various storefronts, the smell of art, the smell of fudge, the smell of books (that was my favorite). There are numerous textures as well, the roughly sanded shingles of the buildings, the warm smoothness of the statues, and the hot roughness of pavers, always so cool in the shade. In retrospect there was the dichotomy of the classes. The wealthy ran things, but the Brazilian immigrants (and occasional white single mother (my mother) actually did all the work. They built and staffed the mansions, cleaned the excessive buildings. My first paid money was a reflection of this. I got paid sixty dollars to clean the baseboards in a wealthy woman’s house. My mother was her cleaning lady and I had expressed an interest in helping her so we could go home early. The wealthy woman saw me lugging stuff and after making sure that my mother wasn’t exploiting me, offered to pay me as well.</p> 
<p>Mama and I lived with my older cousin/grandmother figure. She was Grandpa David’s cousin. Annie had given Mama a loan so that she could go to Oxford. The loan backfired and left us in severe poverty for most of my childhood. She took us in, but it was bittersweet. The feeling of the house was that of a hodgepodge of people who lived under the guidance of a matriarch. We did our best to fit in, but they weren’t our best years.</p>
<p>I recall each room smelling like a mix between sterile paint, and old wood. Other hints of smells emerged depending on how the room was used and how often. The living room had a slight hint of woodsmoke from the fireplace. During the summer the windows were thrown open and the fresh smell of the marsh emerged from the backyard. The windows themselves smelled like cold metal when you got too close. Her house was an odd mix of exotic and bland New England style. A prime example of this was the African fertility statues that sat on the kitchen table next to the bananas.</p>
<p>Mama occasionally tried to get us involved in the church, at the urging of her Catholic boyfriend, and boss. Mainly she was lonely. Martha’s Vineyard isn’t a good place to be a single white mother. She lacked the social support the Brazilian immigrants had with each other, and all the other Caucasians were wealthy or had upper middle class employment. So she went to church and brought me with her. I found the Biblical stories bland and unexciting compared to the vibrant Greek mythos I had grown up with. Where was the drama? In Sunday school all we were taught was the white-washed and politically correct stories. Had they gotten into who had raped who I might have been more interested. As it stood, all church was good for to me was free donuts.</p> 
<p>Things got better when we moved to Brattleboro, Vermont. Mama had a job teaching teen parents and helping them get their General Equivalency Diplomas, and we had our own apartment that looked high over Main Street. I had my own room, finally. It was a far cry from the studio apartment that had cost more than what we were paying for what seemed to me to be a mansion in the sky. In reality it was a small one-bedroom apartment with a cheap landlord in a loud and obnoxious part of town. I got the bedroom while Mama slept out in the living room with her bed serving as the couch in the day time.</p> 
<p>During the Christmas season Mama met Kira, the man who would eventually become my second mother. They had both announced to a mutual friend that they were done looking for love and were going to spend the rest of their lives happily single. The mutual friend introduced them and they were playing footsy by the end of their first evening together. Their romance blossomed with my full support. Mama was happy and not nearly as lonely. She had support systems in place and we weren’t going to church anymore. After a year and a half they got married in a quiet and personal service at the Putney Quaker Meeting House. I stood with them as we all said our vows to each other, red roses in hand as neither of them wore rings.</p> 
	<p>It was during this time that I was first introduced to a pantheon beyond the Greeks or Judaic-Christian. Mama had always made getting me books a priority, even when we were dirt poor in the middle of winter. While not raised in any particular religion, Mama always maintained the attitude that idle hands were the Devil’s playground. She didn’t put it in those exact words of course, but the attitude was the same. Thus I was always busy, sewing, knitting, and, of course, reading. Reading and expanding one’s mind was serious work in my family. This would go on to serve me well in my future quest for knowledge of my religious beliefs.</p> 
<p>But in my preteen year I was introduced to the Young Adult author, Tamora Pierce. She opened my mind to so many possibilities, not just religious, but social as well. Her stories had Lady Knights battling for the good of their kingdoms, Wild Mages who spoke to animals and had fascinating discussions with their teachers, Stitch Witches who wove spells into their cloth. And most of all, her stories had Gods and magic. They contained my first introduction to words and concepts like aura, meditation, ritual, Great Mother Goddess, The Horned One, and many more. Here were characters that lived and loved with their deities, who were looked out for by their patron Gods and Goddesses. I was entranced.</p> 
<p>But I didn’t go anywhere with it. Beyond the fantasy world of my novels I had now frame of reference for incorporating what I so craved into my daily routine. I would go onto read other books with the Mother Goddess in them, “Mists of Avalon,” by Mercedes Lackey, the afore mentioned “Children of the Earth” series by Jean M. Aule. I began to express my religious views only to have them increasingly squashed down as I grew older. Fantasy was all well and good for children, was the message, but now that Mama had a paying job as a social worker and was comfortably settled, it was time to join the reality of the atheists. There was never an explicit discussion regarding her desire for me to leave behind such nonsensical murmurings, but there were smaller, just as poignant conversations throughout my early teen years. I understand now that my anxiety disorder made things hard for her to take me seriously. Mama was never able to tell the difference between the negative “magical” thinking that caused me so much pain (thinking that if I had a moment of resentment toward her she would disappear), and the mystic might that I so needed in my life.</p> 
<p>So I walked through my pre-teen and early teen years in a haze of half formed theories and thoughts regarding what Powers might exist. That is, until I went to Brattleboro Union High School and met Beneth, the English teacher who taught Mythology. She was very clear that many of the so called “mythologies” that she taught were still actively practiced as religions, as in the case of Hindu “mythology,” or had been resurrected through various Neo-Pagan belief systems. It was under her teaching that I finally began to fully explore just what it was that I believed.</p> 
<p>I thought of a higher intelligence that was beyond human comprehension, but with some aspects that could be reached very occasionally. I likened the Being to a rainbow crystal, the kind that people hang in the window, with the rainbows that were cast off being encounters between it and human kind. Like the rainbows the encounters started out sharp and clearly defined, but as the shadows moved (shadows being the passage of time and changes in culture) the rainbow lost its definition and became blurry, losing its original clarity. This to me was a metaphor of how major religions became institutionalized and focused on politics instead of faith. But because all of the rainbows came from the same source they were all simply different paths to the same entity. Thus all the gods and goddesses and spirits were archetypes that allowed humans to conceptualize the Higher Being more easily.</p>
	<p>4. The Recent Years.</p> 
	<p>The latter definition held me until I was in college and was able to take more in-depth Religions of the World class. In between my later teen years and my twentieth year I slowly began to explore Norse Mythology more fully. I had avoided it like the plague when I was younger due to my biological father being very into Thor and his deeds. To my immature mind anything that he liked must be bad, because he was bad. However the more I got into different interpretations of the myths I found that I really liked Loki. I found him to be a fascinating metaphor and archetype. I got Loki in a way that I hadn’t gotten a deity since I had made the connection with Hades as a young child.</p> 
	<p>In the Religions of the World class I was introduced to the book “The World’s Religions” by Huston Smith. Here I found several quotes that both agreed with my previous theology, as well as set the foundation for my new theology.</p>

 <p>To claim salvation as the monopoly of any one religion is like claiming that God can be found in this room but not the next, in this attire, but not another. Normally, people will follow the path that rises from the plains of their own civilization:; those who circle the mountain, trying to bring others around to their path, are not climbing… It is possible to climb life’s mountain from any side, but when the top is reached the trails converge. At base, in the foothills of theology, ritual and organizational structure, the religions are distinct. Differences in culture, history, geography, and collective temperament all make for diverse starting points. Far from being deplorable, this is good; it adds richness to the totality of the human venture (Smith, 1991, p. 73)</p>

<p>And then to start me on my new path came the following:</p>

<p>Man or woman whose mind must bite into something concrete and representational if it is to find life-sustaining meaning. Most people find it impossible to conceive, much less be motivated by, anything that is removed very far from direct experience (Smith, 1991, p 61).</p>

<p>The latter was incredibly reassuring to me, as I had difficulty envisioning a formless Higher Being. I knew that this Being existed, but I had an extreme difficulty connecting to it. My new fascination with Loki came into play. Here was a deity that I could connect to. However I didn’t connect with the typical way that Loki was portrayed in the myths.</p> 
	<p>When first exploring my devotion to Loki I attempted to copy what everyone else was doing to worship Loki. This failed for several reasons. One, there are relatively few devotees of Loki, due to the heavy Christianization of the few texts that describe the Norse Pantheon and Religion. Loki is viewed by these texts as a devil figure, something wicked to be feared and hated. There are those who attempt to follow the texts to the best of their abilities, and view those who ascribe to personal Gnosticisms as doing it wrong. While I admire their dedication, I feel strongly that because most of the texts are at best second hand interpretations of the old ways filtered through the world views of Christian authors, reading between the lines of what is written is necessary.</p> 
	<p>This reading between the lines is what brought me to the second reason my early attempts at worship failed. Out of what little was written on devotion to Loki even less of it felt right to me. To me Loki wasn’t fearsome, wasn’t even necessarily mischievous. These seemed to me to be masks that my Lord wore. They were a part of Him, certainly, but it wasn’t the entirety of Him. I felt that Loki, at His heart, was an outcast for things beyond His control, namely His being Jotun. Because Loki was Jotun He is a force of chaotic nature, capable of things that the Aesir are not. Being able to give birth, His skill with Magic, all are things that are uniquely Loki, and thus Jotun. Thus anathema to the Aesir that Loki spent time with.</p> 
	<p>I created a rather complex metaphor to explain the psychology behind this schism between law/order and nature/chaos that I felt with Him. In order to have good steel you need to mix iron ore with carbon. Too much carbon and the steel is too soft and brittle. In this metaphor the Aesir are iron ore/orderly beings, while the Jottun are carbon/chaos beings. What happened with Loki is that His blood bond with Odin combined the two elements for both of them. Odin gained just enough carbon/chaos to be able to take on some aspects of the trickster, becoming good forged steel. But Loki was still mostly carbon/chaos, with just a little bit of steel to keep Him tied to the paths of the Aesir. But the steel was foreign to His base nature, hence His continuing pranks. When Odin betrayed Him and cast Him to the cave with the snake venom, the acidity of the venom burned away all of the steel/order, leaving behind a very pissed off chaos/ carbon being. This explained one of my core beliefs regarding humanity and the natural forces. The fact that nature would always win in the end, no matter what humanity did to it.</p> 
	<p>I connected with Loki the Outcast, Loki the Ambassador for His Race, Loki the Force of Nature. Once I realized this it immediately dawned on me that I had been worshiping Loki simply by living my life the way I do. By teaching at an inclusive theatre group, by advocating for LGBTQ rights and by being an environmentalist I Honor Loki. By championing the rights of minority groups I champion the Outcasts that are my Lord and His Children. I found that through my work in helping disabled individuals learn to express themselves through theatre I was doing His work. This is what it means to be a devotee of Loki, at least to me.</p>
	<p>Finally I had reached a solid ground for my religion. However it was still lacking. I wanted to do more than live my life in order to worship my Lord. But I still had the problem of wanting to go with the flow regarding my religious practices. I wanted to do things to Honor Him that others had had success with. I wanted to Honor Him the right way. So I meddled about, setting up altars, painting paintings and trying to find a method, or series of methods, that worked for me. </p>
	<p>I came across a couple of barriers when it came to this process. They all boiled down to the fact that I had no confidence in what I was doing. I knew that I had no extra abilities (call them what you will; psychic abilities, magick, etc) so I had no way of knowing whether my prayers and rituals were accomplishing anything at all. I was also still desperately trying to do things “right.” For me doing things “right” meant all natural materials, such as wool, silk, beeswax candles, the good incense, etc. The latter two problems were problematic in another way. I was, and am, a broke college student. There was no way that I could afford to worship Loki in the manner that I felt was fitting for Him. So I bought small trinkets as I could from various thrift stores and felt guilty about the meager stuffs that I could bring to Him as a priestess. </p>
	<p>I had been writing my mythic journey down for some time, preparing for this final paper. So I had my worship on my mind as I wandered the linen section of the local thrift store, seeing what was available. I came across a small bolt of heavy duty red felt. I had been planning for a long while to make another attempt at creating an altar cloth. This red felt was the perfect color and texture for such an endeavor. I could clearly see in my mind’s eye how the gold embroidery would sweep across it. But I stalled before picking it up because I wasn’t sure if it was one hundred percent wool. It was then that revelation hit me as if by a lightning bolt. </p>
	<p>Loki didn’t care if I worshipped Him through these expensive materials. Was He not the Parental Figure of Outcasts? Where His children not of meager means themselves? I could not imagine Him rejecting a stick that His son Fenris brought to Him, no matter how chewed on, or slobbery. If anything, Loki, Deity of tricksters, thieves and those who lived on the margins would appreciate the thought going into the seemingly smallest of Devotions. </p>
	<p>I referred to this revelation later to a friend as realizing that my God didn’t care if I worshiped through polyester. Filled with a new confidence and humbleness I picked up the bolt of red felt (of course it did turn out to be made of wool after all) and went to purchase my find, along with a bit of green cotton for backing. </p>
	<p>Later that day I went to the library, full of eagerness to start looking for new ways to worship my Lord with what I had at hand. I went to the section on Pagan and Wiccan beliefs and browsed. There, as if placed there as a divine sign, was the exact book that I had been looking for. “Global Ritualism: Myth and Magic Around the World,” by Denny Sargent was what I had been looking for all along without knowing it. The book detailed not only rituals and magic performed around the world, but the key archetypes found cross-culturally and how to blend them for one’s own ritual usage. For someone who needed the confidence to create her own rituals this book was perfect. It was the next step on my path as a hedgewitch priestess of Loki, and through Him, the Higher Being. </p>
	<p>5. Creating My Own Rituals</p>
	<p>As I mentioned above, I already sang for my Lord on a regular basis. “Global Ritualism” laid out the framework for me to offer praise in both this form and others. Due to my homeschooling I know a great deal of Pagan-themed folk songs of praise and gratitude for the world and its elements. One of these songs became the framework for my weekly Sabbath. The song is as follows:</p>
<p>The Earth, the Air, the Fire, the Water, Return, Return, Return Return,</p>
<p>The Earth, the Air, the Fire, the Water, Return, Return, Return, Return,</p> 
<p>I-ah, i-ah, i-ah, i-ah, i-ah, i-ah, i-ah i-ah. </p>

<p>This song broke down the elements in an easy to remember chant that is sung during the preparations for the ritual as the items were gathered.</p> 
	<p>While singing this song I gather my altar cloth, as well as my athame, my fan, candles, a small glass of mead, and most importantly, the statue of Loki. The athame represents Earth, with its metal and wood construction. It is tied to Loki visually through the use of flame colored cords and gaudy beads and pendants. The athame as Earth brings solidity to the ritual, and acknowledges that all survival is dependent on the earth for all things. As Denny Sargent states: </p>

<p>The root of all Pagan cultures can be found in the name Pagan. This literally means “of  the Earth.”… The basic tenet of most of the world’s primal religions, those that naturally evolved and were not founded on some revelation or philosophy, revere the earth as the source of all things, and view Nature as the visible reflection invisible world of the spirits or gods/goddesses (1994, p. 12). </p>

<p>The fan represents Air through the use of the once flight-worthy wing of a pheasant and a pine base for the handle. The pheasant wing was given to me while I was attending a wilderness survival home-school program for being considerate of others. The wing is tied to Loki visually through the use of heavy copper wire and a large amber bead that, like the athame, connect to His element of Fire. </p>
	<p>Candles represent the actual element of Fire in this ritual. I use candles purchased at a thrift store so as to acknowledge Loki’s cunning and wise ways. In many cultures lit candles symbolize the banishment of shadows (Sargent, 1994). </p>
	<p>The small cup of mead represents the element of Water. In many cultures alcohol is often given as an offering, as I do here (Sargent, 1994). The cup is a part of my Willow Ware fine china collection, an heirloom from my grandmother. The use of the china ties together life-blood from multiple generations. The mead is used in recognition of the drink of my Scandinavian ancestors and the heritage that Loki brings. </p>
	<p>The statue of Loki is one that I had purchased off of Amazon.com. It is designed for altar work and has the images of His Outcast children on the sides. The image shows His merriment and good cheer, while also showing darkness in His eyes. </p>
	<p>The altar cloth required the most planning. I decided to incorporate several magical archetypes described in “Global Ritualism.” First the border of the altar cloth is a rectangle. The rectangle and the square are found throughout the world to represent “stability, earthing power, material solidity, and geometric symmetry” (Sargent, 2016, p. 39). At each side of the altar cloth is a triangle pointing towards the center that contain a symbol for each of the elements. Triangles are often used ritually as a representation of the triple aspect of reality (Sargent, 2016). In the center of the altar cloth is a circle containing the Norse rune “Laguz.” Circles are the most common form of ritual space and symbolize the myriad cycles of life (Sargent, 2016). The Laguz rune is Loki’s rune for several reasons. Laguz represents the phoneme “L,” as well as representing the concepts of “formlessness, chaos, potentiality, the unknown” (McCoy, 2016). All of these represent the natural chaos that Loki so embodies. </p>
	<p>The ritual itself is fairly simple. After everything is gathered I state the latter song clearly as I place each ritual element according to its space on the altar cloth. The athame goes on the Northern edge/the top, the fan goes on the Eastern edge/the right, the candles go on the Southern edge/the bottom, and the mead goes on the Western edge/the left. Finally during the “i-ah” section of the chant I place the statue of Loki in the center circle, atop the Laguz rune. From there I bow to my Lord and sing songs of praise and gratitude. If I am struggling with something I ask for guidance should He so choose to give it. When I am done I blow out the candles, pour the mead onto the earth outside and put everything away until next time. </p>
	<p>6. Conclusion</p>
	<p>We live in a world of endless information. Most of this information is available to us whenever we seek it, yet the information we are given at the beginning of our life moulds us in ways that are hard to identify. By acknowledging where one got one’s beginnings one is able to identify internal biases and perceptions of the world around us. However we are able to grow outside of what we are taught from a young age. By creating one’s own story, one’s own myth, one is able to tell where one fits in the universe. As Sargent states: </p>
<p>(F)ollowing one’s own mythos, one’s own path…is more likely to result in a more fulfilling life than playing a script one is handed by one’s culture, family, and friends. It could also change the world (1994, p. XXVIII). </p>
